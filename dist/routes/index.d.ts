/**
 * API Routes
 *
 * This file defines all the API routes for our application.
 * Routes are organized by feature (auth, parcels, orders) for better maintainability.
 *
 * In commercial applications, you might want to:
 * - Add rate limiting
 * - Add request validation middleware
 * - Add API versioning
 * - Add comprehensive logging
